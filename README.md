# Welcome to my page! 
Hi, I'm Julian! **I'm a data analyst at the Department of Buildings in New York City, and I study data science at City Tech**. I've been obsessed with data ever since taking my first statistics course, and I've been adding skills to my arsenal ever since. I'm currently practicing my SQL and Tableau skills, and hoping to get a data analyst job that helps me put those skills to the test. Feel free to browse my works!
