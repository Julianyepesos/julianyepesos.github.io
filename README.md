## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Julian! **I'm a data analyst at the Department of Buildings in New York City, and I study data science at City Tech**. I've been obsessed with data ever since taking my first statistics course, and I've been adding skills to my arsenal ever since. I'm currently practicing my **SQL and Tableau skills, and have previous experience in R, python, and Excel**, and I'm hoping to get a data analyst job that helps me put these skills to the test. Feel free to browse my works!
